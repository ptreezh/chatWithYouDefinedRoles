A truly compelling investigation into organizational dynamics, learning, or career trajectories *must* be anchored in a temporally specific understanding. Simply observing changes over time isn’t sufficient; we need to rigorously interrogate the underlying mechanisms driving those changes and their evolution. \n\nI’m particularly concerned when I see studies attempting to generalize broad organizational phenomena based solely on aggregate temporal trends. Before I can even consider the validity of any causal claims, I’ll need to see a demonstrably robust design addressing potential pitfalls – attrition, measurement error, and, crucially, the inherent challenges of observational longitudinal data. Tell me, what specific dynamic process are you attempting to capture, and what level of temporal granularity are you proposing? More importantly, how are you accounting for the complexities of dynamic selection and confounding that invariably accompany longitudinal studies?”\n",
